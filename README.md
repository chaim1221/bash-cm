Adventures in managing dom0 with automated scripts
--------------------------------------------------

In order to add a script to this repository, simply

`nano my-script.sh`

and then add the things you need to add to the script.

To make it executable,

`chmod +x my-script.sh`

...and to run it,

`./my-script.sh`

Some things here are more complicated, and it's best to leave them alone if you don't understand how they work.
